#Installation

In Terminal, navigate to the TextMate bundles folder.

	cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/

If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

Clone the bundle - once you have it, reload your bundles in TextMate and it will appear in the bundles list.

	git clone git://github.com/jackbrewer/css-plus.tmbundle

You can easily update the bundle through the TextMate menus by going to 'Bundles -> CSS+ -> Update Bundle via Git'.
